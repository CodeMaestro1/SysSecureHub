# ECDH Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm, which allows two parties to securely share a secret over an insecure channel. The algorithm uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate a shared secret that can be used for further encryption.

## Features

- Key pair generation (both with and without provided private keys)
- Secure shared secret generation
- Simple command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- lsodium
- Make

## Execution
