# SysSecureHub

Welcome to *SysSecureHub*! This repository contains projects developed for the **" Security of Systems and Services"** course at the Technical University of Crete. Each folder corresponds to a different assignment, showcasing various aspects of security. All assignments are standalone and can be run independently.

## Assignments Overview

We have implemented the following assignments:

1. **Assignment 1**:
   - Implementation of **Elliptic Curve** and **RSA** cryptographic algorithms.  
2. **Assignment 2**:
   - Development of a custom **logger** in C for secure and efficient logging.  
3. **Assignment 3**:
   - A real-time **malware detection system** capable of identifying security threats as they occur.  
4. **Assignment 4**:
   - A comprehensive **security analysis** of a web application, including vulnerability identification and exploitation.
5. **Assignment 5**:
   - Implementation of a **packet sniffer** capable of capturing and analyzing network traffic, including both TCP and UDP packets, in real-time or from offline packet capture files.
6. **Assignment 6**:
   - Development of a custom **firewall** capable of filtering incoming packets based on user-defined rules.
7. **Assignment 7**:
   - Implementation of snort rules for **intrusion detection** and **prevention**.
8. **Assignment 8**:
   - Exploit development for **buffer overflow** vulnerabilities.
